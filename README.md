Front-end application made with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) to help me and my colleagues check university schedule easily. Contains schedule filters and an intelligent algorithm to tell what class is next and display it in an elegant way.

## Installation
To install simply clone the repository and run `npm install` inside. Then modify and run it like you would any Svelte app.
